"What career fits on me?" A question most of the students or people were asking, it might be just a simple sentence or question but for those who really want to have a good career or for those want to be successful in their career this means a lot to them because someday this will help them to be successful.Planning for their future is a good thing, planning and making a wise decision is the key for having a career that fits on you, because when you have a wise decision and start planning for it you may succeed earlier.In my own opinion choosing your career is better if you will depend or if it is base on your talents or skills if you will have a hard time in choosing, well depending on your talents/skills is a right thing to do because if you choose something that you really can't do or if it is very difficult for you to do it then maybe it's because of not having enough practice or skills.
